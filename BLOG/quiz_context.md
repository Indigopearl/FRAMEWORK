### context_get_data

Imagine you have a model named `Article` and you're using Django's `DetailView` to display a single article. You also want to pass some extra context to the template, say a list of related articles.

```python
from django.views.generic import DetailView
from .models import Article

class ArticleDetailView(DetailView):
    model = Article
    template_name = 'article_detail.html'

    def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
        # First, call the base implementation to get the default context
        context = super().get_context_data(**kwargs)

        # Add some extra context data
        related_articles = Article.objects.exclude(pk=self.object.pk)[:5]  # for simplicity, fetching the first 5 articles excluding the current one
        context['related_articles'] = related_articles

        return context
```

In this example, `get_context_data` is overridden to add a queryset of related articles to the context. Now, in the `article_detail.html` template, you can loop through `related_articles` to display them.
