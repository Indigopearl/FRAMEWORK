    "\n",
    "Django’s built-in User model allows us to start working with users right away, as we just did with our Blog app in the previous chapters. However, most\n",
    "large projects need a way to add information related to users, such as age or any number of additional fields. There are two popular approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first-and older approach-is called the “User Profile” approach and extends the existing User model by creating a OneToOneField to a separate model\n",
    "containing fields with additional information. The idea is to keep authentication reserved for User and not bundled with non-authentication-related user\n",
    "information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second approach, to create a custom user model, is recommended in the official Django documentation. We can extend AbstractUser to create a\n",
    "custom user model that behaves identically to the default User model but provides the option for customization in the future.\n",
