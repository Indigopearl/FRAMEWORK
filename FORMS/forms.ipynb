    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for this circular import is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When Django starts, it tries to set up the URL configuration.\n",
    "2. As part of the URL configuration setup, it will attempt to import all views related to the URLs.\n",
    "3. When importing the `views.py` file, the module-level statement `success_url = reverse(\"home\")` is executed. !! **class-level attributes in Python classes are evaluated when the module is imported** !!\n",
    "4. The `reverse` function will try to resolve the \"home\" URL pattern.\n",
    "5. To resolve the \"home\" URL, Django needs to look at all URL configurations again.\n",
    "6. If the \"home\" URL is related to one of the views in this `views.py` file (or even indirectly related due to including other URL patterns which in turn depend on this `views.py`), it results in a circular import: Django is trying to import `views.py` while it's already in the process of importing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `reverse_lazy` instead of `reverse` fixes the issue because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `reverse_lazy` doesn't immediately resolve the URL when it's defined. Instead, it waits until the URL is actually needed. \n",
    "- In the case of class-based views, this means waiting until an instance of the class (e.g., `BlogDeleteView`) is created and the `success_url` is accessed.\n",
    "- By the time the URL is actually accessed in this manner, the URL configuration has been fully loaded and set up, thus avoiding the circular import.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, changing the line to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "success_url = reverse_lazy(\"home\")\n",
