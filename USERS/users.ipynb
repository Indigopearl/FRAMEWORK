    "**1. Requests are Stateless:**\n",
    "In the world of web technologies, the HTTP protocol, which forms the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web, is stateless. \n",

    "This means that each request from a client to a server is treated as an isolated transaction with no memory of previous requests. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the perspective of the server, every request is a new one, without any context from prior interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Web Sessions:**\n",
    "Because HTTP is stateless, there arose a need to maintain some **sort of state** during user interactions on websites, especially for scenarios like online shopping, logging into user accounts, etc. This is where web sessions come into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "A web session is a mechanism used to store user-specific information on the server side during multiple request-response interactions. Sessions can be implemented in various ways, like using cookies, hidden form fields, and server-side session management. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose is to give the user a continuous experience, as if the server \"remembers\" them, even though HTTP by nature does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. User and State:**\n",
    " The \"state\" refers to any data or information about that user's interaction that we want to maintain across multiple requests. This state can include things like login status, items added to a shopping cart, user preferences, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "    - In Django, the session ID for the current user's session can be accessed using `request.session.session_key`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **How Django Handles Session Key Generation**:\n",
    "    - Django will automatically generate a unique `session_key` when session data is first set for a user.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Session Initialization in the Example**:\n",
    "    - If a user doesn't already have a session (i.e., `request.session.session_key` is `None`), we initialize session data for them using `request.session['example_data'] = 'This is some session data.'`.\n",
    "    - This action will cause Django to automatically generate a `session_key` for the user if they didn't already have one. On subsequent requests, `request.session.session_key` will have a value, which means the user has an active session.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Storing the Session Key**:\n",
    "    - Django will automatically send the `session_key` to the user's browser as a cookie named `sessionid` by default.\n",
    "    - The browser will return this cookie with every subsequent request to the Django server, allowing the server to identify the user's session and retrieve any associated data.\n"
