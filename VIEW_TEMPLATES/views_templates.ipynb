    "## Creating a Custom Split Filter in Django\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Writing the Filter Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate to your app's directory and create a `templatetags` directory if it doesn't already exist. Within the `templatetags` directory, create a Python file, e.g., `custom_filters.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside `custom_filters.py`, start by importing the necessary modules and then write your custom filter function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django import template\n",
    "\n",
    "register = template.Library()\n",
    "\n",
    "@register.filter(name='custom_split')\n",
    "def custom_split(value, arg):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Splits the value by a given string (arg).\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    return value.split(arg)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This `custom_split` function takes in a value (which should be a string) and an argument (the delimiter by which to split the string) and returns a list of substrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Using the Filter in Templates\n",
    "\n",
    "Before using the custom filter, ensure that your app is added to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in your project's `settings.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any template where you'd like to use the filter:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the custom filters at the top of your template:\n",
    "\n",
    "```django\n",
    "{% load custom_filters %}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use the filter in the template:\n",
    "\n",
    "```django\n",
    "{{ \"This,is,a,test\"|custom_split:\",\" }}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output will be a list: `['This', 'is', 'a', 'test']`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Advanced Usage (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can expand upon this basic filter by adding more features. For instance, you can handle cases where the delimiter is not provided (default to a space) or limit the number of splits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "With the custom `custom_split` filter in place, you have more flexibility in splitting strings in your templates. Custom filters in Django provide a powerful way to introduce reusable transformations and manipulations that can be applied directly in the template layer."

    "#### for loop tag and if tag\n",
    "\n",
    "In Django templates, you can also combine the `{% for %}` loop with conditional `{% if %}` statements to iterate over lists and display content conditionally. Here's how you can do that:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Django Template Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume you have a list of users and you want to display only those who are active:\n",
    "\n",
    "Context:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "users = [\n",
    "    {'name': 'Alice', 'active': True},\n",
    "    {'name': 'Bob', 'active': False},\n",
    "    {'name': 'Charlie', 'active': True},\n",

    "        <li>{{ user.name }}</li>\n",
    "    {% endif %}\n",
    "{% endfor %}\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- The template iterates over each `user` in the `users` list.\n",
    "- For each `user`, it checks the `active` attribute using the `{% if %}` tag.\n",
    "- If `user.active` is `True`, it displays the user's name inside a list item.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rendered HTML will only show the names of active users:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Alice</li>\n",
    "    <li>Charlie</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination of `{% for %}` and `{% if %}` tags in Django templates allows for powerful yet readable conditional rendering based on lists or other iterable data structures."

    "## Using a Mixin in a Django View\n",
    "\n",
    "Mixins are a way to reuse code across multiple class-based views. They can be particularly useful when certain patterns of behavior are needed across multiple views but don't necessarily warrant a full-fledged parent class. In this example, we will create a mixin that ensures a user is active (i.e., not deactivated) before they can access the view.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Defining the Mixin\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's define a mixin that checks if the user accessing the view is active. If the user is not active, they'll be redirected to a custom error page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a file named `mixins.py` in your app's directory and add the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.http import HttpResponseForbidden\n",
    "\n",
    "class ActiveUserRequiredMixin(object):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Mixin to ensure the user is active.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def dispatch(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\n",
    "        if not request.user.is_active:\n",
    "            # This can be replaced with a redirect or a custom error page\n",
    "            return HttpResponseForbidden(\"You're not an active user.\")\n",
    "        return super(ActiveUserRequiredMixin, self).dispatch(request, *args, **kwargs)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Applying the Mixin to a View\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have our mixin ready, let's apply it to a view. For this example, we'll use a basic `TemplateView`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your `views.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.views.generic import TemplateView\n",
    "from .mixins import ActiveUserRequiredMixin\n",
    "\n",
    "class DashboardView(ActiveUserRequiredMixin, TemplateView):\n",
    "    template_name = 'dashboard.html'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the order of inheritance: the mixin should come before the view base class. This is because the `dispatch` method in the mixin should be the first one to be invoked.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Configuring the URL\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure that the view is reachable by configuring its URL in your `urls.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.urls import path\n",
    "from .views import DashboardView\n",
    "\n",
    "urlpatterns = [\n",
    "    path('dashboard/', DashboardView.as_view(), name='dashboard'),\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Testing the Mixin\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run your Django server.\n",
    "2. Navigate to the `/dashboard/` URL.\n",
    "3. If you're logged in as an inactive user, you should see the \"You're not an active user.\" message.\n",
    "4. If you're logged in as an active user or not logged in at all, you should be able to access the dashboard view (or be redirected to the login page if you're using Django's authentication views and the user is not authenticated).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Mixins allow you to modularize and reuse specific pieces of functionality across different views. The `ActiveUserRequiredMixin` is just one simple example. You can build more complex mixins that handle different types of checks, add context data, or even modify the behavior of the view based on specific conditions."
